##### Intro and CS Background

Hello! I'm Brandon, and I'm currently a student enrolled in Powell's CSE 110 class. I'm super excited (and nervous) about being back on campus this year. 

Personally, I'd say my experience with programming is still elementary. I've coded in Java and C++, and I'm comfortable with most forms of syntax with both languages. However, I've never really applied my knowledge of programming outside of academia.

Obviously, I love computers, but one of the main reasons why I'm taking this class right now is to finally get familiar with the software development process. Sure, I've coded before in Java and C++, but I've never actually gone through the process of making a program/application from scratch.

Some additional things I want to achieve are:
- [ ] Learn C#
- [ ] Apply my coding knowledge to create games
- [ ] Connect with more people in the industry

##### Personal Bio
I'd say I am an introverted person, but I still love hanging out with friends and new people. Sometimes I can be a bit lazy, but I always live off this Bill Gates quote:
> “I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.” -Bill Gates

Work smarter, not harder, right?

Some of my hobbies include:
- gaming
- playing piano
- getting boba with friends

Currently, my favorite games are
1. Apex Legends
2. Valorant
3. Hearthstone

I need some way to quote code, so I'll present you with my favorite sorting algorithm:
```
while not Sorted(list) do
    shuffle (list)
done
```
Just get lucky, and you'll always get *O(n)* runtime.

I also like to do some LeetCode problems in my free time. [Here](https://leetcode.com/bradoche19/) is a link to my profile. Don't expect too much though.
